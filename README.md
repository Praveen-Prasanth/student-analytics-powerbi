# 📊 Student Performance Analysis - Power BI Project

This repository contains a Power BI report built to analyze student academic performance using publicly available datasets. The goal of this project is to gain insights into factors influencing test scores, attendance, behavior, and demographics.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard was created to explore and visualize patterns in student data, using both demographic and academic metrics. It provides clear visuals on student performance, behavior, absences, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).

Key questions addressed include:

- How do gender, ethnicity, and lunch programs impact test scores?
- Which students are at risk based on behavior or academic trends?
- How does absence relate to performance?
- What school-wide trends can be identified from the dataset?

## 🧠 Features of the Dashboard

- KPI cards for average scores and pass/fail percentages
- Slicers for filtering by gender, race/ethnicity, lunch, etc.
- Trend analysis on absences and test scores
- Drill-down features to explore individual student performance
- Interactive visuals using bar charts, scatter plots, and tables

## 📂 Files Included

- `formula_1.pbix` — The complete Power BI report file
- `README.md` — Documentation explaining the project and datasets

> _Note:_ You will need Power BI Desktop to open and interact with the `.pbix` file.
